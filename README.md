# CCSync [Bootstrap + Vite]

# CCSync: A PHP-Based Student and Semestral Management System for Digitized Record Keeping and Record Efficiency  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
**CCSync** is a PHP-based student and semestral management platform designed to streamline and digitize organizational processes, starting with the College of Computer Studies.  
It manages student records, requirements, events, and officer information, ensuring smooth and paperless transactions.  
The system aims to replace manual forms and logs for semestral requirements (such as membership fees and event attendance) with a centralized, consistent, and accessible platform.
