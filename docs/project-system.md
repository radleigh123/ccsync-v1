### Difference Between `npm run dev` and `npm start`

- `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot-reloading. This is ideal for development as it allows you to see changes in real-time without needing to manually refresh the browser.
- `npm start`: Builds the project for production. This command compiles the application into optimized static files that can be deployed to a web server.

> **In short:**
> - Use `npm run dev` for development.
> - Use `npm start` to preview production.
